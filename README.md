## ðŸ§¬ Saimiri VCF Filtering Workflow

This repository provides a complete workflow for **VCF quality control and hard filtering** of *Saimiri boliviensis* genomic data.  
The protocol follows best practices inspired by **GATK**, **vcftools**, and **bcftools** recommendations, as well as criteria from  
[NÃºria et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06901-3).

The main guide, [`Saimiri_vcf_filtering_workflow.md`](./Saimiri_vcf_filtering_workflow.md), details each filtering step â€” from raw unfiltered VCFs to a finalized high-quality dataset ready for population genomic analyses (e.g., PCA, admixture, structure).
